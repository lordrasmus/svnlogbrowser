                              =============

Requirements
------------

- Webserver with PHP 4 or 5
- MySQL
- Python 2.4
- MySQLdb (the python module)
- Bash (sorry Windows users)
- Commandline SVN Client

The scripts are written in a way that it's possible to configure a secondary
server to do the updates so the web frontend only requires MySQL and PHP.
Though this isn't currently easy to setup, and isn't very efficient.

Not-So-Quick Start
------------------

1. Setup a new MySQL database and user with access to that database.
2. Run the SQL script provided (mysql.sql) on the new database to setup
   the table structure.
3. Edit the svnlog2xml.sh script, and configure the name to use for your
   repository along with the URL to the SVN repository.
4. Run svnlog2xml.sh. This will retrieve all the logs from your repository in
   XML format up to the latest revision and save them locally. Make sure the
   script is executable first. This may take a while to run depending on if
   the SVN server is remote, and how many revisions there are.

   $ chmod +x svnlog2xml.sh
   $ ./svnlog2xml.sh

5. Edit the svnxml2db.py script, and configure the name (using the same name
   you used in svnlog2xml.sh) and MySQL database information.
6. Run svnxml2db.py. This will parse the XML files retrieved with
   svnlog2xml.sh and add them to the MySQL database. Make sure this script is
   executable as well. This may also take a while to run depending on if the
   MySQL database is remote, and how many revisions it needs to add.

   $ chmod +x svnxml2db.py
   $ ./svnxml2db.py
